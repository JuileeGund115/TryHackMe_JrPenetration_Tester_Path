# Introduction to Pentesting

> 💥 [TryHackMe: Introduction to Pentesting](https://tryhackme.com/paths)

This module introduces the purpose, ethics, and methodology behind penetration testing — simulating attacks to find vulnerabilities in a controlled and authorized environment.

## 🔍 What Is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing (or "pentesting") is the **authorized simulation of a cyber attack** on systems, networks, or applications to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

---

## 🧰 Pentesting Fundamentals

### 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Scope**: Clearly define what can and cannot be tested.
- **Authorization**: Testing must always be legal and explicitly approved.
- **Rules of Engagement**: Agreed limits on test duration, techniques, and potential impact.
- **Reporting**: Document findings clearly to help the organization remediate issues.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Ethics in Pentesting

- Work **within legal boundaries**
- Never exceed scope
- **Do no harm**
- Always aim to improve security

## 🔁 Pentesting Methodologies

Most pentesters follow frameworks or structured phases:

### 🧭 Common Testing Phases:

1. **Reconnaissance** – Gather open-source intelligence (OSINT) and identify targets.
2. **Scanning & Enumeration** – Identify live systems, open ports, and services.
3. **Gaining Access** – Exploit vulnerabilities to get initial foothold.
4. **Maintaining Access** – Optional step for simulating persistence (red team focus).
5. **Privilege Escalation** – Attempt to gain higher-level access on a system.
6. **Covering Tracks** – Simulated (but not executed) to show how real attackers hide.
7. **Reporting** – Most important part! Must clearly explain risks, impacts, and fixes.

📝 **Note**: TryHackMe emphasizes safe, educational testing — never practice outside legal labs.

## 🔐 Principles of Information Security

This section revisits the **core pillars of cybersecurity** and why pentesting exists — to **defend and strengthen** these principles.

### 📊 Security Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Only authorized users should access sensitive data |
| **Integrity** | Data must remain accurate and unmodified |
| **Availability** | Systems should remain usable and accessible |
| **Authentication** | Verifying identity before granting access |
| **Authorization** | Granting appropriate levels of access |
| **Accountability** | Actions must be traceable to individuals (logging, auditing) |

## 📝 My Notes & Reflections

- Pentesting is more structured than I expected — **it's not just hacking**, it's reporting, scoping, and testing responsibly.
- Learned about **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)** and **OWASP Testing Guide** — useful frameworks.
- Good pentesters are not just skilled attackers, but also **good communicators**.
- I'm particularly interested in the **reconnaissance and exploitation** stages.
