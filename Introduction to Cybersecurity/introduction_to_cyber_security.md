> 🛡️ [TryHackMe: Introduction to Cyber Security](https://tryhackme.com/paths)

This module provides an overview of what cybersecurity is, the difference between offensive and defensive roles, and the variety of careers available in the industry.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Cyber Security** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
- It includes two main categories:
  - **Offensive Security**: Simulating attacks to discover and fix vulnerabilities.
  - **Defensive Security**: Preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber threats.

## 🔴 Offensive Security Intro

In this section, you get hands-on experience simulating a real attack — legally and in a controlled environment.

### 🧰 What You Learn

- The mindset of an attacker (ethical hacker).
- Basics of how websites can be attacked.
- Common attack vectors (e.g., form manipulation, login bypass).
- Introduction to hacking tools and environments.

### ✍️ Notes

- I completed my **first legal web hack** — felt like the real deal.
- Key takeaway: **"Think like an attacker"** to better defend systems.
- Tools like **Burp Suite**, **Kali Linux**, and **web proxies** are often used.

## 🔵 Defensive Security Intro

This section focuses on the other side: protecting against attacks and responding to them.

### 🧰 Topics Covered

- **Threat Intelligence**
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**
- **Malware Analysis**
- **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)**

### ✍️ Notes

- Defensive security is **more layered and analytical** than I expected.
- SOC analysts monitor alerts and handle real-time incidents.
- DFIR sounds fascinating — like being a digital detective!

## 👨‍💻 Careers in Cyber

Cybersecurity is a wide field with technical, analytical, and even policy-related roles.

### 🔎 Sample Roles

| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Penetration Tester** | Simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities |
| **SOC Analyst** | Monitor, detect, and respond to threats |
| **Threat Hunter** | Proactively look for undetected threats |
| **Security Engineer** | Build and maintain secure systems |
| **GRC Analyst** | Governance, Risk, and Compliance |
| **Malware Analyst** | Analyze and reverse-engineer malware |
| **Incident Responder** | Investigate and contain breaches |

### ✍️ Notes

- Cybersecurity isn't just about hacking — it's a **team effort** with many specialties.
- I'm interested in both **pentesting** and **DFIR** as possible career paths.
- Certifications like **CompTIA Security+**, **CEH**, or **OSCP** are mentioned often.
